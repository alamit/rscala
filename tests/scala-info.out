Cannot find a suitable Scala installation.

Scala (>= 2.11) is not distributed with the rscala package.  Individuals can
install Scala using "rscala::scalaInstall()" which places Scala in "~/.rscala"
in the user's home directory.  System administrators should install Scala
globally as described here: http://www.scala-lang.org/download/install.html.
In short, simply download the archive, unpack it, and add the "scala" script to
the path.  Note that Scala itself requires Java.  The rscala package tries
various techniques to find a suitable Scala installation, including searching
the path.  Details on the search is available using
"rscala::scalaInfo(verbose=TRUE)".
